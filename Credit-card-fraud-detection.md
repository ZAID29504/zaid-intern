🔍 Project Description: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

📌 Objective:

Implement a robust credit card fraud detection system using classification techniques, with a focus on Logistic Regression.
🛠️ Methodology:

Data Collection:

Gathered a dataset containing credit card transactions with labeled fraud and non-fraud instances.
Data Preprocessing:

Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature scaling if necessary.
Feature Engineering:

Extracted relevant features and transformed them to enhance the model's performance.
Model Selection:

Chose Logistic Regression as the primary classification algorithm due to its interpretability and efficiency in binary classification tasks.
Training and Testing:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained the Logistic Regression model on the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Generated a classification report to assess the model's performance, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
Constructed a confusion matrix to visualize true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Explored tuning options for the Logistic Regression model to optimize its performance.
Results Interpretation:

Interpreted the coefficients of the logistic regression model to understand the impact of different features on fraud prediction.
Model Deployment:

Deployed the trained model for real-time or batch predictions in a production environment.
📊 Evaluation Metrics:

Classification Report:
